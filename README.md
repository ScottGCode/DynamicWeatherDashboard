# DynamicWeatherDashboard

## Description

I wanted to be able to search for current weather in any city to help plan travel. I needed to be able to search for a city and see the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast for the city searched. I wanted my search history to be saved so I could easily see the weather for a city that was previously searched. I chose to build a dynamic 5 day weather forecast dashboard that displays current weather and a 5 day forecast in any city that a user searches. When a user types in a city and clicks search they will be presented with the weather data in the browser. This application will also save your search history using localStorage so you can easily click and see the weather for a city you previously searched. You can search the weather for any city in the world! During this project I learned how to obtain data from an open weather api and dynamically display it on the webpage. I learned how to work with an open weather api to communicate weather data such as wind, humidity, and weather condition.
